# Recommender Systems Effect on Content Diversity
Diversity on RecSys

### Introduction - An ABM approach for 

Digital markets depend on information filters that make the massive flow of interaction manageable for suppliers, distributors, and consumers. Beyond this operational cornerstone, information filters also have a passive role on how markets organize and behave. The design of these filters has a significant role on who gets what, funneling consumers into few suppliers or promoting obscure products and services that can better satisfy consumer needs. The potential effect of recommendations appears to be larger on cultural or entertainment and media industries, where productâ€™s uncertainty is usually high. As such, cultural diversity and market concentration on content platforms (e.g. Google News, YouTube, Spotify) are susceptible to the effect of recommendation systems algorithms. The study of diversity has been a focal topic for individual recommendation optimizations, but little attention has been given to aggregated measures of diversity. Previous work on this area states that collaborative based recommender systems have an impact on sales diversity. I expand on this presenting an agent-based model to test the impacts of state-of-the-art recommender systems on cultural markets. Using heterogeneous agents to represent user behavior and specific market situations, the model works as a framework to estimate the effects of recommender system algorithms on sales and cultural diversity. Early results confirm previous work on the effect of collaborative filtering methods on diversity. The next step of this project includes the use of machine learning algorithms. Future work will provide useful insights for marketing modeling, content platform policy, and the use of information filters in market design.
